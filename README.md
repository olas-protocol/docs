# Introduction

These are _mostly_ technical documents that outline the various components, mechanisms and user interaction with the [Olas Protocol](https://olas.info/). For a deeper discussion of the motivations behind Olas, please refer to the videos and blog posts on the website.&#x20;

The Olas protocol is compromised of a number of sub-protocols to meet its goal of being the most trusted information platform on the internet.

The platform itself will be an autonomous protocol existing on a distributed network of computers outside of any single administratorâ€™s control to guarantee neutrality. It will be deployed on a decentralised network specifically geared towards servicing infinite scale web applications.&#x20;

A decentralised identity protocol along with a proof-of-unique human protocol incorporated will ensure each account is a real human being rather than AI and also that each human can only establish a single identity. This is essential in preventing [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack).

Quadratic funding protocols and subsidies will ensure economic sustainability and prevent a [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy\_of\_the\_commons) as contributors provide information free of advertising and subscriptions. In addition to this, there will be a tipping protocol where giving tips to journalists/scientists/bloggers will be as simple as liking a social media post is now.

Quality control will be achieved by market and reputation-based protocols that ensure healthy incentives for accuracy both over the short and long term. There will be four types of information sectors with fundraising and/or quality control mechanisms specifically designed for the unique characteristics of each of these sectors.&#x20;

1. Reporting of existing facts&#x20;
2. Offering an opinion
3. Discovering new information via investigative journalism
4. Discovering new information via scientific research

A tagging protocol will ensure articles on a given subject matter will be easily searchable across the entire platform.&#x20;

A curating protocol will enable either humans or autonomous bots construct publications from Olas articles.  &#x20;

Finally, royalties protocols whereby any contributor whose work is referenced, or used in the case of photographers, will receive remuneration.&#x20;
