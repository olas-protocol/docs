# Introduction

These are technical documents that outline the various components, mechanisms and user interaction with the Olas Protocol. For a deeper discussion of the motivations behind Olas, please refer to the videos and blog posts on the website.&#x20;

The Olas protocol is compromised of a number of sub-protocols to meet its goal of being the most trusted information platform on the internet.

The platform itself will be an autonomous protocol existing on a distributed network of computers outside of any single administratorâ€™s control to guarantee neutrality. It will be deployed on a decentralised network specifically geared towards servicing infinite scale web applications.&#x20;

A decentralised identity protocol along with a proof-of-unique human protocol incorporated will ensure each account is a real human being rather than AI and also that each human can only establish a single identity. This is essential in preventing [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack).

Quadratic funding protocols and subsidies will ensure economic sustainability and prevent a [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy\_of\_the\_commons) as contributors provide information free of advertising and subscriptions. In addition to this, there will be a tipping protocol where giving tips to journalists/scientists/bloggers will be as simple as liking a social media post is now.

Quality control will be achieved by market and reputation-based protocols that ensure healthy incentives for accuracy both over the short and long term. There will be three types of markets designed specifically with the three types of information that are published on the internet:

1. Reporting of existing facts
2. Offering an opinion
3. Discovering new facts via investigative journalism or scientific research

A tagging protocol will ensure articles on a given subject matter will be easily searchable across the entire platform.&#x20;

Finally, a royalties protocol whereby any contributor whose work is referenced will receive remuneration.&#x20;
