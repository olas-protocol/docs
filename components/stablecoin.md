# Stablecoin

There has been a search for a stable cryptocurrency that fulfils the these three criteria for many years. All attempts have endeavoured to maintain a peg to USD and all attempts have failed.&#x20;

There are broadly two types of attempts that have failed. The first group, the algorithmic stablecoin group, failed through ponzi economics. In this scenario, the value of the collateral and the stablecoin produced on top of it are based purely on faith rather than any real underlying economic activity distinct from the monetary economics. The collateral exists purely to produce the stablecoin and has no demand for any other reasons. When a run on the currency begins, there is therefore nothing to stop it resulting in these attempts collapsing spectacularly.&#x20;

The second attempt uses collateral that is demanded for other reasons such as cryptocurrencies like ether that are demanded in order to be able to write to the Ethereum ledger, something many people wish to do. These pegs work because they are overly collateralised and the positions can be liquidated before the stablecoin breaks its peg with the dollar. This prevents a collapse but reduces the supply of the currency at precisely the time people demand it.&#x20;
