# Initial Monetary Subsidy

It's entirely unrealistic to expect that Olas become ubiquitous soon after launch. It will take some time to develop a large user base. It will also take time for blockchain payments infrastructure to become embedded in the global economy.&#x20;

In the absence of advertising and subscription revenue, Olas will therefore need to lean on investors to subsidise activity on the platform. Of course this is no different to how many tech business models even outside the blockchain sphere.&#x20;
