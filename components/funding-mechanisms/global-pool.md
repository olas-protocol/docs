# Global Pool

The **Olas Global Matching Pool** is a pivotal element within the Olas ecosystem, designed to facilitate the equitable distribution of financial resources to support news articles and content creation. In this section, we will delve into the purpose, mechanisms, and functions of the Olas Global Matching Pool.

The _Olas Global Matching_ Pool serves as a central funding repository where **passive donors**, _such_ as high-net-worth individuals, government entities, and other interested parties, contribute their funds. These funds are earmarked to support contributors, media producers or journalists based on various criteria, including their reputation scores and past work.

The Olas subsidy allocation rewards sub-pools based on their performance and engagement, ensuring equitable distribution of funds. Metrics include active donors, total donations, tippers, and total tips. Normalised scores are averaged for an overall score, with higher scores receiving more subsidies.

The sub-pool ranking system assesses content quality, audience engagement, community contributions, and reputation. Sub-pools are periodically ranked to guide subsidy allocation and incentivise high standards. Key metrics considered in the subsidy allocation process include Active Donors, Total Donations, Tippers, and Total Tips.
