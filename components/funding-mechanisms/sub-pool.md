# Sub-Pool

**Olas Sub-Pools** are specialized funding channels within the Olas ecosystem, tailored to support contributors and encourage active donor participation in specific content areas. These sub-pools play a crucial role in the sustainable funding of news articles and content creation.

Olas administrators deploy sub-pools for specific subject matters or themes where articles are needed. This focused approach ensures that contributors receive funding for creating content that aligns with current demand and community interests.

One of the distinguishing features of Olas Sub-Pools is the utilization of a **quadratic funding mechanism**. This mechanism allows active donors to allocate their resources based on their preferences and valuations of individual contributors.

Olas Sub-Pools operate under a performance-based allocation system, directing resources towards those consistently producing high-quality journalism and engaging with their audience. This approach rewards excellence and incentivizes journalists to maintain high reporting standards.

By focusing on specific topics and utilizing quadratic funding, Olas Sub-Pools contribute to the creation of diverse, high-quality news articles, fostering a thriving media ecosystem.
