# Subsidy Allocation Mechanism

Although Olas employs a [quadratic funding mechanism](funding-mechanism/) to distribute funds among contributors writing on the same topics, the platform needs another mechanism to allocate passively donated funds to news topics in the first place. This mechanism is dedicated to news reporting and opinions as investigative journalism/academic research have a unique fundraising mechanism.&#x20;

### **Funding Sources and Allocation**

At the heart of Olas' funding ecosystem lies the Olas [Global Pool](funding-mechanism/global-pool.md), a pool of funds contributed by [passive donors](broken-reference), such as high-net-worth individuals and government entities. These donors are committed to generally supporting journalism, ensuring that financial resources are available to support diverse and high-quality reporting.

The Global Pool isn't controlled by anybody and funds allocated by it are determined by a number of metrics in a credibly neutral manner. This decentralized approach ensures that the allocation of resources is transparent, accountable, and aligned with the community's priorities.

### **Sub-Pool Establishment and Journalist Participation**

To support focused reporting, The Olas Foundation will establish specialised sub-pools of the global pool. It will have no say over how these pools are funded however. These targeted funding pools cater to journalists covering specific topics or localities. The approach enables the financing of a broad range of subjects increasingly overlooked by an ever centralising mainstream media employing an economic model ill-suited to fostering diversity.&#x20;

### **Ranking Algorithm for Sub-Pool Allocation**

Olas uses a ranking algorithm to fairly and effectively distribute subsidies to sub-pools. This algorithm considers various factors:

1. Number of active donors in each sub-pool, indicating community engagement and support.
2. Total donations received by each sub-pool.
3. Number of tippers in each sub-pool, indicating direct support for individual journalists.
4. Total tips received by each sub-pool, demonstrating overall appreciation for journalists' work.

### **Fund Distribution and Journalist Allocation**

Higher-ranked sub-pools get more funding based on their performance, ensuring resources support top-quality journalism and community engagement.

Journalists in each sub-pool receive funds proportional to their received donations, incentivising high-quality content production.

### **Initial Ranking and Consecutive Rounds**

Initially, all sub-pools on Olas have an initial ranking, allowing new sub-pools to establish themselves and gain support from active donors without the pressure of a ranking system. However, as sub-pools evolve and demonstrate their value, they are gradually integrated into the ranking system, ensuring that subsidies are distributed fairly and effectively.
