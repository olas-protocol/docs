# Tagging System

The Tagging System implemented on Olas serves as a pivotal tool for curating and constructing a comprehensive knowledge graph. This system is instrumental in realising various key features outlined below.

### Olas-Generated Tags

Each [Topic Pool](broken-reference) created on the Olas platform is systematically associated with a set of pertinent tags. These top-level tags play a central role in categorising and organising content within the Olas Ecosystem.

### User-Generated Tags

Content Contributors play an active role in enhancing the tagging system by associating their articles with existing tags during the initial submission process. The relevance of these tags is subjected to rigorous quality assurance processes specific to the relevant market. For instance, in [Fact Reporting Markets](broken-reference), the scrutiny of tag relevance is conducted by a Judging Panel.

Content Contributors also possess the capability to introduce new top-level tags or incorporate lower-level tags (entities), thereby contributing to a more nuanced and intricate tagging structure.

### **Taxonomy**

The tagging system adheres to a customisable taxonomy. Top-level tags directly align with the Topic Pools in the Olas ecosystem. Content Contributors are empowered to create lower-level tags (entities) to refine and elaborate on the tagging system, ensuring a more granular classification of content.

### Content Flagging

To mitigate the spread of **misinformation**, Olas employs a content flagging mechanism. Older articles are visibly marked with their publication year, and readers are provided with a list of **recently tagged** articles related to the same tag. This practice ensures that readers remain cognizant of newer publications associated with a specific tag.

### Aggregation & Searchable

Content is seamlessly aggregated based on both top-level tags and lower-level tags (entities). The system facilitates a robust search functionality, enabling users to locate specific tags and delve into more detailed entities. This ensures a streamlined and efficient content retrieval process within the Olas ecosystem.
