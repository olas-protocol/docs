# Funding Mechanism

Olas has a unique funding mechanism that uses a combination of quadratic funding and sub-pools to incentivise high-quality reportage.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how the Olas funding mechanism works:

[**Olas Global Matching Pool**](global-pool.md)

The Olas Global Matching Pool, fuelled by donations from individuals, governments, and institutions, supports the platform's ecosystem. These donors, valuing independent journalism, back contributors based on their merit.

[**Olas Sub-Pools**](sub-pool.md)

Olas Sub-Pools are deployed by Olas admins for topics that require regular reporting. Active donors fund sub-pools in the form of votes. The sub-pool uses a quadratic funding mechanism where votes or donations cost individuals as much as they value the contributor. This means that the sub-pool is a quadratic funding instance and contributors are like individual projects asking for funding.

**Performance-Based Allocation**

Olas implements a performance-based allocation system to ensure fair and effective distribution of funds[.](../subsidy-allocation-mechanism.md) This system evaluates the performance of each sub-pool based on a set of metrics that reflect their engagement, support, and overall contribution to the Olas community.

**How it Works**

A contributor who wants to create reportage can submit a proposal to a sub-pool. Active donors can then vote on the proposal and donate money to the sub-pool. The amount of money that a donor donates is equal to the square root of the amount that they value the contributor. This means that donors who value the contributor more will donate more money.

The contributor with the most votes at the end of the voting period will receive the most funding from the sub-pool. The contributor will also receive a portion of the funds from the global matching pool.

**Benefits of the Olas Funding Mechanism**

The Olas funding mechanism offers several benefits, including:

* It incentivizes high-quality reportage. Contributors who create high-quality reportage are more likely to receive funding from the sub-pools.
* It prevents contributors from being funded based on their popularity or name recognition. The quadratic funding mechanism ensures that contributors are funded based on the value that they provide to the community.
* It allows donors to have a say in which reportage is created. Donors can vote on the proposals that they want to fund.

The Olas funding mechanism is a unique and innovative approach to funding reporting. It has the potential to revolutionize the way that reportage is produced and consumed by incentivizing high-quality reportage and preventing contributors from being funded based on their popularity or name recognition.
