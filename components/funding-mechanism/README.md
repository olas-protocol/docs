# Funding Mechanism

Olas has a unique funding mechanism that uses a combination of quadratic funding and sub-pools to fund a wide range of voices and geographies.&#x20;

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how the Olas funding mechanism works:

[**Olas Global Matching Pool**](global-pool.md)

The Olas Global Matching Pool is open for anyone to donate to at any time. It is envisaged that avid readers, high net worth individuals, corporations and governments, many of whom have an interest in an informed society, will donate to this pool.&#x20;

[**Olas Sub-Pools**](sub-pool.md)

Olas Sub-Pools are deployed by Olas admins for topics that require regular reporting. Active donors participate in funding competitions that occur in these sub-pools. A quadratic funding mechanism where votes or donations cost individuals as much as they value the contributor is the primary determinant of outcomes.&#x20;

**Demand-Based Allocation**

Olas implements a market-based allocation system to ensure fair and efficient distribution of funds to the topics that deserve them most[.](../subsidy-allocation-mechanism.md) This system evaluates the level of interest in articles in each sub-pool based on a set of metrics that reflect this interest.

**How it Works**

A contributor who wants to write on the platform can enter a funding competition in a given sub-pool. Active donors can then vote on the proposal and donate money to the sub-pool. The amount of money that a donor donates is equal to the square root of the amount that they value the contributor. This means that donors who value the contributor more will donate more money. Contributors will receive a matching donation from the sub-pool equivalent to the number the earn according the above formula.&#x20;

**Benefits of the Olas Funding Mechanism**

The Olas funding mechanism offers several benefits, including:

* It allows funds be allocated in a decentralised non-hierarchical fashion, somewhat removing politics from the equation
* It ensures local and niche news isn't overlooked by&#x20;
* It removes politics from funding decisions&#x20;
*

The Olas funding mechanism is a unique and innovative approach to funding reporting. It has the potential to revolutionize the way that reportage is produced and consumed by incentivizing high-quality reportage and preventing contributors from being funded based on their popularity or name recognition.
