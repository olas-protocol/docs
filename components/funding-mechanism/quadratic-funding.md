# Quadratic Funding

Charity has been used for centuries to raise money for various projects and causes. It typically involve donors giving money to individuals or organizations, sometimes in exchange for nothing, sometimes in exchange for benefits such as tax breaks, social recognition, or access to exclusive goods or services.

Quadratic funding is a radically new funding mechanism that not only seeks to create private markets for public goods, but seeks to do so in a way that more accurately reflects broader community preferences than vanilla market mechanisms do. It achieves this by employing a matching pool for donations to competing projects and employing a formula that gives more weight to the number of people that donate than the amount of money donated.&#x20;

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between traditional funding mechanisms and quadratic funding:

Here is a diagram explaining the difference between traditional and quadratic funding mechanisms:

Olas uses a quadratic funding mechanism to fund reporting. Quadratic funding is a funding mechanism where donors contribute money to a pool, and the money is then distributed to contributors based on how much support they receive from other donors. This helps to ensure that the best contributors are funded, even if they are not the loudest or most well-known.

In Olas, contributors compete with each other to raise funds from sub-pools. Active donors fund sub-pools and active donors can vote on the proposals that they want to fund. The amount of money that a donor donates is equal to the square root of the amount that they value the proposal. This means that donors who value a proposal more will donate more money. The contributor with the most votes at the end of the voting period will receive the most funding from the sub-pool.\
This competition between contributors can help to ensure that the best projects are funded. It also gives donors a greater say in which projects are funded.

Let's understand this with the help of a diagram:
