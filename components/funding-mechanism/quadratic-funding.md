# Quadratic Funding

Let's understand why Olas uses a quadratic funding mechanism over a traditional funding mechanism.

Traditional funding mechanisms have been used for centuries to raise money for various projects and causes. These mechanisms typically involve donors giving money to individuals or organizations in exchange for a variety of benefits, such as tax breaks, social recognition, or access to exclusive goods or services.

Quadratic funding is a newer funding mechanism that has been gaining popularity in recent years. It is a decentralized funding mechanism that uses blockchain technology to match donations to funding recipients (Contributors in the case of Olas) based on the number of unique donors and the total amount donated.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between traditional funding mechanisms and quadratic funding:

Here is a diagram explaining the difference between traditional and quadratic funding mechanisms:

Olas uses a quadratic funding mechanism to fund reporting. Quadratic funding is a funding mechanism where donors contribute money to a pool, and the money is then distributed to contributors based on how much support they receive from other donors. This helps to ensure that the best contributors are funded, even if they are not the loudest or most well-known.

In Olas, contributors compete with each other to raise funds from sub-pools. Active donors fund sub-pools and active donors can vote on the proposals that they want to fund. The amount of money that a donor donates is equal to the square root of the amount that they value the proposal. This means that donors who value a proposal more will donate more money. The contributor with the most votes at the end of the voting period will receive the most funding from the sub-pool.\
This competition between contributors can help to ensure that the best projects are funded. It also gives donors a greater say in which projects are funded.

Let's understand this with the help of a diagram:
