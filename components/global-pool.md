# Global Pool

The _Olas Global Matching_ Pool is the protocol's central funding repository. Without funding for this pool, Olas will be unable to sustain itself as a huge amount of the system relies on funds. Since the donors to this pool have no say over what happens to the money they donate, they are known as [passive donors](../../participants/donor.md).&#x20;

It is envisaged and expected that such donors will be high-net-worth philanthropists, governments, and other interested parties such as people that currently donate money to Wikipedia to sustain its operations. All of these entities currently give huge amounts of money annually to support information provision. Since Olas is an open system with credibly neutral quality control mechanisms, it will enable these donors to make a much greater impact with their money than they do now.&#x20;
