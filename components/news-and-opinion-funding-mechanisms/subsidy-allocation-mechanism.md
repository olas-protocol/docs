# Subsidy Allocation Mechanism

Although Olas employs [quadratic funding ](./)competitions to distribute funds among contributors writing on the same topics, the platform needs another mechanism to allocate passively donated funds to news topics in the first place before those competitions can take place. This mechanism is dedicated to news reporting and opinions as investigative journalism/academic research have a unique fundraising mechanism.&#x20;

### **Funding Sources and Allocation**

At the heart of Olas' funding ecosystem lies the Olas [Global Pool](global-pool.md), a pool of funds contributed by [passive donors](broken-reference), such as high-net-worth individuals and government entities. These donors are committed to supporting journalism in a general sense, ensuring that financial resources are available to support diverse and high-quality reporting.

Since the Global Pool isn't controlled by any single entity, funds must be allocated by it using decentralised mechanisms. The challenge with using such mechanisms is to design them so they cannot be gamed by colluding agents. Olas has been designed with this in mind so that funds are allocated in a transparent, accountable and credibly neutral manner.&#x20;

### **Sub Pool Establishment and Journalist Participation**

To support diverse reporting, The Olas Foundation will establish specialised sub-pools of the global pool at the request of users. It will have no say over how these pools are funded however. These targeted funding pools cater to journalists covering specific topics or localities. The approach enables the financing of a broad range of subjects increasingly overlooked by an ever centralising mainstream media employing an economic model ill-suited to fostering a plurality of voices.&#x20;

### **Ranking Algorithm for Sub Pool Allocation**

As is the case with contributor competitions, Olas uses a quadratic formula to distribute subsidies to sub pools based on the number of people plus the level of economic activity occuring in each sub pool. These measurements are taken from both methods of subsidisation: 1. Public Goods Funding (donations) 2. Retroactive Public Goods Funding (tips). The reason quadratic rules are used is to take a better measurement of the wider community. For a deeper discussion on quadratic funding refer to following sections. This algorithm considers various factors:

1. Number of active donors that participated in previous funding rounds in each sub-pool.
2. Total donations received by each sub pool.
3. Number of tippers in each sub pool.
4. Total tips received by each sub pool.

### **Fund Distribution and Journalist Allocation**

Sub pools pools are ranked according to quadratic rules which are biased more towards the number of donors rather than the amount of money donated. This makes it far harder for the wealthy to game the system. The ranking system in turns determines their share of the global pool at the funding snapshot each quarter. In order to prevent contributors '[banging the close](https://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Banging\_the\_Close)' to artificially increase their funding prospects an average ranking across the entire quarter will be used.&#x20;

### **Mininum and Maximum Funding**

In order to guard against the short-term whims of consumers of news causing centralisation of topics covered, Olas will ensure that there will be a minimum amount of funds available for any topic there is at least some demand for, no matter how small that demand is, as well as a maximum any pool can receive. The goal here is to avoid the ever-narrowing breadth of topics or over-funding of fashionable topics that occures in centralised news and science media.  &#x20;
