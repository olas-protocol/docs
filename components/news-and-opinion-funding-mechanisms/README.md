# News & Opinion Funding Mechanisms

Olas is an ownerless non-profit protocol that aims to replace advertising and subscriptions as the dominant economic models in the information industry. In the absence of both these models, charity becomes the only viable option to fund contributors. Further, without any central authority to allocate funds raised across the platform, well-designed mechanisms robust to collusion and control by the wealthy that reflect real community preferences are required. Olas will harness the very latest scientific advances in market designs for public goods funding in order to achieve this.&#x20;

Funds will be allocated across topics and writers using credibly neutral mechanisms.&#x20;

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how the Olas funding mechanism works:

[**Olas Global Matching Pool**](../global-pool.md)

The Olas Global Matching Pool is open for anyone to donate to at any time. It is envisaged that avid readers, high net worth individuals, corporations and governments, many of whom have an interest in an informed society, will donate to this pool.&#x20;

[**Olas Sub Pools**](../sub-pools.md)

Olas sub pools are deployed by Olas admins for topics that require regular reporting. Active donors participate in funding competitions that occur in these sub pools.&#x20;

[**Demand-Based Allocation**](subsidy-allocation-mechanism.md)

Olas implements a market-based allocation system to ensure fair and efficient distribution of funds to topics and journalists that deserve them most[.](subsidy-allocation-mechanism.md) This system evaluates the level of interest in articles in each sub-pool based on a set of metrics that reflect this interest.     &#x20;

**How it Works**

A contributor who wants to write on the platform can enter a funding competition in a given sub pool. Active donors can then vote on the proposal and donate money to the sub pool. The amount of money that a donor donates is equal to the square root of the amount that they value the contributor. This means that donors who value the contributor more will donate more money. Contributors will receive a matching donation from the sub pool equivalent to the number the earn according the above formula. If there are insufficient funds allocated to the sub pool by the global matching pool, matched donations will be paid as a percentage of the share of the pool contributors earn on account of the quadratic rules. &#x20;

**Benefits of the Olas Funding Mechanism**

The Olas funding mechanism offers several benefits, including:

* It allows funds be allocated in a decentralised non-hierarchical fashion, somewhat removing politics from the equation
* It frees contributors from editorial direction imposed by private owners of newspapers and science journals
* It enables contributors to grant open access to their work without needing to worry about being rewarded for it&#x20;
* It ensures local and niche information is economically viable&#x20;
