# Quadratic Funding Competitions

Charity has been used for centuries to raise money for various projects and causes. It is a tried and tested method for subsidising valuable stuf that markets are not well suited to improving. However, since funds are not subject to competitive market forces - governments often only permit one charity for each cause - they are not regularly very well used. Government spending on public infrastructure and services faces a similar problem. Consequently many have posited it's preferable to subject public goods funding to [private market forces](https://www.brookings.edu/books/private-markets-for-public-goods/) in a hybrid system.  &#x20;

Quadratic funding is a radically new funding mechanism that not only seeks to create private markets for public goods to improve outcomes, but seeks to do so in a way that more accurately reflects broader community preferences than vanilla market mechanisms do. It achieves this by establishing a matching pool for donations to competing projects and by using a formula that gives more weight to the number of people that donate than the amount of money donated. In this sense it's akin to a middle ground between democracy (one person, one vote) and markets (one dollar, one vote).&#x20;

Here is a diagram explaining the difference between a theoretical centralised vanilla funding competition and an open quadratic funding competition in the Olas protocol:

Instead of a committee allocating funds to projects in an X-Factor style competition prone to corruption, funds from donors are matched against available funds in a matching pool. The matching pool for each individual competition represents funds allocated to a given topic by the [subsidy allocation mechanism](subsidy-allocation-mechanism.md).  Therefore contributors that propose to write on the same topics compete with each other to raise funds from sub-pools. Donors will likely pay a lot of attention to how the journalists have previously performed with their written output, bringing market competition to the provision of these public good (free) articles. The expectation is that this will vastly improve journalists' output - especially given how the [information markets](../information-markets/) are structured.   &#x20;

The way quadratic funding is a better reprentation of the wishes of the broader community than a vanilla market more prone to the influence of the wealthy is via its implementation of a quadratic rule. \


Let's understand this with the help of a diagram:
