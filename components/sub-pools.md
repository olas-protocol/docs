# Sub Pools

Between the _Olas Global Pool_ are two layers of sub pools. The first consists of just three pools that represent the funding available to the three types of [information markets](information-markets/) on the protocol:

1. News/facts reporting&#x20;
2. Opinion/Analysis&#x20;
3. Investigative journalism & scientific research

The Olas Foundation will decide each quarter how much the share of global pool funds each of these pools get each quarter based on its analysis of how each pool is serving demand. This is the only centralised governance decision that is ever taken on the protocol meaning the foundation has zero say over which contributors or projects receive the funding. It's merely a general allocation decisionn that'll have marginal bearing on specific funding outcomes.&#x20;

Below this layer of sub pools is a further layer. These sub pools represent topics/issues/areas of research. Funding allocated to these from the three primary sub pools is done so via decentralised methods. The mechanisms by which this happens for news/facts and opinoins is outline [here](news-and-opinion-funding-mechanisms/subsidy-allocation-mechanism.md).  The mechanisms by which this happens for investigative journalism and scientific research happens [here.](investigative-journalism-and-scientific-research-funding-mechanisms/)&#x20;
