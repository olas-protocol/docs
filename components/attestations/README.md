# Attestations

## What is an Attestation?

An Attestation is a novel primitive introduced in the domain of Web3, aimed at enhancing decentralised reputation tracking mechanisms. It is a verifiable claim, often endorsed by a third party, concerning the actions, traits, or credentials of a participant within a network. Cryptographic security is fundamental to attestations, facilitating a transparent and trustworthy process for affirming the reputation and credibility of individuals or entities within the network.

### Key Components of an Attestation:

* **Issuer**: The entity creating and signing the attestation.
* **Subject**: The entity to whom the attestation pertains.
* **Claims**: The specific statements or assertions made about the subject.
* **Signature**: The cryptographic signature of the issuer validating the authenticity of the attestation.

### Why are Attestations Important for Citations?

Attestations provide a structured mechanism for:

* **Trust Establishment:**
  * They help in creating trust in a trustless protocol by providing endorsements from credible sources.
* **Transparency and Verifiability:**
  * The cryptographic foundation of attestations ensures a transparent and verifiable trail of endorsements, which is pivotal for a fair reputation assessment.
* **Incentivisation and Accountability:**
  * Attestations enable the recognition and rewarding of commendable content contributions, while also providing a means to track and penalise dishonest or malicious activities, thereby cultivating a culture of accountability.
* **Interoperability:**
  * Standardised attestations can be shared across diverse platforms and applications within the Web3 ecosystem, promoting interoperability and a more cohesive editorial management framework.

## Attestations in Olas

As part of the Olas ecosystem, attestations are used by Content Contributors as a mechanism to verify the authenticity of their work and to acknowledge the use of other authors' content in the formation of their arguments. Specifically, attestations are used for:

**Evidence Trail:**

* When a Content Contributor makes a claim, they can attest to the work of others to provide evidence and context to what they are saying.&#x20;

**Royalty Allocation:**

* By accurately recording the value that previous authors have created via their writings, attestations can be used in the equitable future distribution of retroactive royalty rewards.

By leveraging the use of attestations, Olas facilitates a structured, transparent, and equitable editorial management system. This approach to editorial management aims to align the incentives of all stakeholders towards a communal objective of trust and quality.
