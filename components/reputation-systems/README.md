# Reputation Systems

## Understanding Reputation Score

A Reputation Score (RS) is a numerical representation of a market participant's trustworthiness and expertise within the Olas ecosystem. A reputation score is assigned to individuals who assume qualifying roles within each of the respective information markets, such as **Content Contributors, Fact Checkers,** or **Judges**. An individual's RS fluctuates based on their interactions and performance within each market. The RS system is designed to encourage market participants to make quality contributions and to be held accountable for the work they carry out on the platform.

### Improving Your Reputation Score:

* **Quality Contributions**: Consistently contribute high-quality content or submit valid inaccuracies to enhance your RS. For example:
  * **Content Contributors:** Enhance RS by creating high-quality content that garners a favourable accuracy score from the information market participants.
  * **Fact Checkers:** Submit inaccuracies that are validated by an expert judging panel.
  * **Judges**: Cast votes that successfully align with the judging panel's consensus on pertinent issues. This market alignment demonstrates engagement and expertise in your given topic.
* **Educational Resources**: Utilize educational resources provided by Olas to better understand the expectations and standards of the community, which can help align your contributions accordingly.
* **Regular Review**: Regularly review feedback received on your contributions to identify areas of improvement.

## Reputation Score Case Studies&#x20;

### Case Study 1: Content Contributor

**Scenario**: Alice, a content contributor, regularly submits well-researched and well-written articles on Olas. Over time, her RS improves, leading to improved earning potential via an increased number of tips, external funding via investors, and matching funds from the Olas Global Pool.

### Case Study 2: Fact Checker

**Scenario**: Bob, a diligent fact-checker, identifies several critical inaccuracies in various articles. His accurate fact reporting elevates his RS,  which enhances his earning potential by granting him access to exclusive judging panels whilst also being rewarded for each of the inaccuracies he has submitted.

### Case Study 3: Judge

**Scenario**: Charlie, a judge, consistently provides fair and insightful judgments whilst voting in judging panels, thereby maintaining a high RS. However, several instances of rushed, inaccurate judgments cause a slight dip in his RS, temporarily limiting his access to more exclusive and higher-paying judging panel opportunities until he regains his previous RS by making better judgments in subsequent judging panels.



These case studies underscore the dynamic nature of an individual's RS within Olas, illustrating how different actions and roles interact with the reputation system to shape an individual's experience, earning potential, and opportunities within the ecosystem.
