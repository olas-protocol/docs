# Investigative Journalism & Scientific Research Funding Mechanisms

Investigative journalism and scientific research provide incalculable value to humanity. Unlike most other private market activities however, the value these things create for society isn't often reflected in the rewards to those that provide the product. The reason for this is that the costs of corruption and the benefits of public goods aren't often clear because they are born by large numbers of people. Nevertheless they are often enormous. Journalists that uncover corruption and scientists that make discoveries that aren't protected by patents barely capture a tiny fraction of this value because our private market systems are poorly suited to rewarding them relative to the value they create for society.&#x20;
