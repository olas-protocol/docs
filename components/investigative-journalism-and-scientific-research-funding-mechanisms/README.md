# Investigative Journalism & Scientific Research Funding Mechanisms

The amount of funding required for investigative journalism and scientific research dwarfs that required for news reporting and opinion. Further, the value they offer to society through exposing things like corruption and unearthing information that can greatly improve people's lives can be enormous. Private business models are terrible at enabling investigators and researchers to capture these rewards if their discoveries aren't patentable however. The intermediation of funding by insitutions also produces poor incentives such as disincentives to provide funding to investigate government corruption or the incentive to only research fashionable topics or to falsify findings in order to be published and receive further funding.

Olas aims to remedy these problems by offering investigators and researchers mechanisms via which they can directly seek investment from people who can share the rewards from a large payout from the Investigative Journalism and Scientific Research Sub Pool. These incentives can grant investigators and researchers with the resources they need whilst still ensuring payouts will only occur for legitimate discoveries. Larger donations are achieved by offering more concentrated payouts Native tipping will ensure those that make very important public good discoveries can capture much more of the value of those discoveries. &#x20;

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how the Olas funding mechanism for news and opinion works:

Every quarter a certain percentage of the donations of avid readers, high net worth individuals, corporations and governments will be allocated to the Investigative Journalism Pool by the Olas Foundation.&#x20;
