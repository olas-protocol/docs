# Investment and Funding Competitions

The relatively large funding costs for these types of contributions require a stronger incentive system than charity to encourage money to flow into the system. Although the economic model will still be based on charity, we believe the significance of the discoveries in this sector will result in large amounts of donations in the form of tips subsequent to publication and evaluation. This in turn will enable contributors to offer investors the chance to share in these donations and make a profit from their investment. Further, given the highly specialised knowledge required for these topics, as well as the fact discoveries in this sector benefit everyone and not just concentrated interests, there is no need for a quadratic funding mechanism to guard against the influence of big money.&#x20;

In light of this we propose a hybrid system analogous to the public-private partnerships we often see in many industries today. As in the other information sectors, Olas will make a pool of funds available for Investigative Journalism and another available for Scientific Research every quarter. There will also be funding rounds. However, unlike the other sectors, funding will only be granted once a market has given a research project a score. Further, the payout will be from a shared global pot rather than a pot that has been set aside for a specific contributor. This increases greater uncertainty of funding from Olas as central funding is somewhat outside of each project's control. The number of other projects, their scores and their cost base are significant factors that determine a project's payout. However, since contributors get access to the funds in advance, in contrast to the other markets, the risk is not borne by them. It is borne by their funders. The reward for this risk, as stated above, is the possibility of making a profit on investment. This is a much more suitable system for this sector given the relative costs and possible rewards.

Here is the chronology of the fund raising process:

1. The process begins with an investigative journalist or scientist (or groups of either) making a proposal for research.&#x20;
2. They will state a budget and what percentage of the profit they are willing to share for a raise that covers the bugdet. They will also state a timeline for the research and project milestones. A deadline for the raise must be set so that funders who commit funding can receive it back within a certain timeframe rather than it being indefinitely committed to a project that isn't reaching its target. However, if funders agree, they can roll their funds over to a new raise on deadline day.&#x20;
3. If the target is met, a tranche of funds will be released to start the project. Researchers will constantly have to update funders on their work and funders will vote by simple majority to release more funds when requested by the researchers.&#x20;
4. Once the research is completed, it'll be given a score and a costs award by a [review market](../information-markets/investigative-journalism-and-academic-research-markets/review-markets.md). This costs award may be lower than the declared budget.&#x20;
5. At the end of that quarter, the project will receive funding from the Investigative Journalism Funding Pool or the Scientific Research Funding Pool based on its score, its costs award and also the respetive scores and awards of everyone else competing for the quarterly payout.&#x20;

WE NEED A DIAGRAM THAT COVERS POINTS 1, 2 & 3. POINT 4 WILL BE COVERED IN THE INFORMATION MARKETS SECTION SO IGNORE. THEN WE ALSO NEED TO FORMALISE AND MAKE A DIAGRAM OF POINT 5.&#x20;
