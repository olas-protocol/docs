# Investment and Funding Competitions

The relatively large funding costs for these types of contributions require a better incentive system than charity to encourage money to flow into the system. Although the economic model will still be based on charity, we believe the significance of the discoveries in this sector will result in large amounts of donations in the form of tips subsequent to publication and evaluation. This in turn will enable contributors to offer investors the chance to share in these donations and make a profit from their investment. Further, given the highly specialised knowledge required for these topics, the democratic slant of quadratic funding is of little benefit in this sector.&#x20;

Here we propose a hybrid system analogous to the public-private partnerships we often see in many industries today.&#x20;
