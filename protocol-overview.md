# Protocol Overview

Olas consists of three information markets: **Fact Reporting Market**, **Investigative Journalism & Academic Research Markets,** and **Opinion Markets**. These markets follow a similar process from a high level with differences in how the incentives work via specific mechanism designs.&#x20;

A high-level overview of Olas:

1. Olas provides Content Contributors with the flexibility to either secure funds through Quadratic Funding or personally stake their own money on work they submit to the protocol
2. Active Donors (ones that actively choose which contributors to fund) and Passive Donors (ones that donate to a global Olas funding pool) are both involved in the quadratic funding process
3. When an article is submitted to an information market it must be accompanied by a stake
4. The mechanisms differ for each of these information markets due to their unique characteristics
   1. For the **Fact Reporting Market**, there is a partially randomly selected closed-membership Judging Panel consisting of Fact Checkers and Judges
   2. For the **Investigative Journalism & Academic Research Markets,** there is an open traditional prediction market with a large subsidy from Olas
   3. For the **Opinion Markets,** there is a prediction market based on a Bayesian Truth Serum mechanism design
5. After publication, readers can tip the article to support the content contributors directly. However, the tips only go to the contributor if their market-based score is sufficient&#x20;
6. A Reputation Engine updates the reputation scores of different participants based on their interactions and performance within each market
