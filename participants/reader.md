# Reader

Readers are an essential part of OLAS, contributing to content discovery, validation and community engagement, while benefiting from high-quality content and supporting independent journalism.

### Becoming a Reader

Accessing content as a reader on OLAS is straightforward, allowing users to explore and consume content without mandatory signups. Readers can freely browse and consume diverse content across OLAS categories without needing to have an account.

For more interactive engagement, readers have two sign-up options:

1. **Traditional signup/Web2 medium:** Participating in activities like opinion markets or tipping can be done through traditional web2 mediums by signing up. This method offers access to interactive features with the need for account creation.
2. **Web3 medium:** For a more streamlined and direct approach to engagement in opinion markets or tipping, using a web3 wallet allows seamless participation, eliminating the signup process and providing direct access to interactive OLAS features.

### Rights and Responsibilities

1. **Access to diverse, independent and high-quality content**
2. Users can comment on articles but only when they pay to do so. The payment will go to the journalist or Olas (or partially to both) depending on the article's score.&#x20;
3. Financial support authors by **tipping** them as a token of appreciation for their work. If the article's score isn't good, the tip will go to the global Olas pool and be used to support other contributors. This mechanism will prevent populist journalism.&#x20;

### Incentives

Consumers of information will desire to use Olas for a number of reasons. It will be an open platform free of advertising, subscriptions or even sign-ups. It will be a single platform where anyone can visit to obtain any type of information they require, greatly reducing the friction and cost of obtaining knowledge.&#x20;

The platform being neutral and all information being subject to robust decentralised quality control mechanisms will mean people can have high levels of trust in the information they obtain. Consumers can also profit from any insights they may have themselves by fact checking errors they find in news articles and datasets, as well as participating in prediction markets for opinions, investigative journalism and scientific research questions. Gamefying information consumption like this can add to the entertainment aspect of the news as well as giving readers excellent insight into to how the crowd views certain opinions.&#x20;

Finally, they can support contributors they value in a much more targeted and low-friction way than is possible in the subscription model where one must buy information in a bundle.
