# Academic Research Markets

Problems:

1. Peer review is politicised
2. Bias against reporting negative results
3. No incentive to research stuff that can't be patented
4. Anti-corruption investigations are costly and there's little payoff&#x20;
5. Anti-corruption investigations are dangerous. Often difficult to receive a platform. &#x20;

Olas has a tri-market system to remedy all these.&#x20;

WE NEED AN OVERALL DIAGRAM OF ALL THE MARKETS TOGETHER. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS CAN LOOK AT REVIEW AND REPLICATION MARKETS IN MORE DEPTH.&#x20;
