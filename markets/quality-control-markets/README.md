# Quality Control Markets

A high-level overview of Olas markets:

1. Olas provides C**ontent Contributors** with the flexibility to either secure funds through Q**uadratic Funding**, personally stake their own money on work they submit to the protocol or in the case of **investigative journalism and scientific research (IJSR)**, seek investment.&#x20;
2. **Active Donors** (ones that actively choose which contributors to fund) and P**assive Donors** (ones that donate to a global Olas funding pool) are both involved in the quadratic funding process. Investors and passive donors are involved in IJSR markets.&#x20;
3. When an article is submitted to an information market it, must be accompanied by a stake.
4. The mechanisms differ for each of these information markets due to their unique characteristics
   1. For the **Fact Reporting Market**, there is a partially randomly selected and partially closed-membership Judging Panel consisting of fact checkers and judges
   2. For the **Opinion Markets,** there is a prediction market based on a Bayesian Truth Serum mechanism design
   3. For the **Investigative Journalism & Academic Research Markets,** there is a three market system consisting of methodology checkers, judges, a replication market and another layer of fact checkers and judges
5. After publication, readers can tip the article to support the content contributors directly. However, the tips only go to the contributor if their market-awarded score is sufficient&#x20;
6. A Reputation Engine updates the reputation scores of different participants based on their interactions and performance within each market
