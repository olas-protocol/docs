# Tipping System

The tipping system is a new way for readers to show their appreciation for articles and reward authors for their work. Tips can be made in fiat currency or cryptocurrency, and are stored in a smart contract on the blockchain until the article is judged and given a score. Based on the article score, the smart contract then releases the tip to the author.

The tipping system is designed to be transparent, efficient, and cost-effective. Readers can see exactly where their money is going and how it is being used. Tips are processed directly through the smart contract, without the need for any intermediaries. Transaction fees are low, and there are no hidden costs.

The tipping system also offers several benefits for authors. Firstly, it provides them with a new way to generate income from their work. This can help authors to become more independent from traditional media outlets and to focus on creating the content that they want to create. Secondly, the tipping system can help authors to build a more engaged community around their work. When readers tip authors, they are essentially saying that they value their work and want to see them continue to produce high-quality content. This can be a powerful motivator for authors and can help them to create even better work in the future.
