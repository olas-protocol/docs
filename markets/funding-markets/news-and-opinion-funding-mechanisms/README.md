# News & Opinion Funding Mechanisms

The primary goal of Olas is to make all non-private information free to all. The secondary goal is to remove systemic economic incentives that create conflicts of interest for truthful and accurate information. Subscription and advertising based models are incompatible with these goals. That leaves Olas with only one other possible economic model given how trivial it is to reproduce information: Charity.&#x20;

Charity has been used for centuries to raise money for various projects and causes. It is a tried and tested method for subsidising valuable stuf that markets are not well suited to improving. However, since funds are not subject to competitive market forces - governments often only permit one charity for each cause - they are not regularly very well used. Government spending on public infrastructure and services faces a similar problem. Consequently some have posited it's preferable to subject public goods funding to [private market forces](https://www.brookings.edu/books/private-markets-for-public-goods/) in a hybrid system. &#x20;

Further, without any central authority to allocate funds raised across the platform, well-designed mechanisms robust to collusion and control by the wealthy that reflect real community preferences are required to prevent Olas degenerating into what exists now with merely a fa√ßade of decentralisation.&#x20;

Funds will be allocated across topics and writers using credibly neutral mechanisms.&#x20;

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how the Olas funding mechanism for news and opinion works:

[News and Opinion Sector Pool](../../../components/funding-pools.md#sector-pools)

Every quarter a certain percentage of the donations of avid readers, high net worth individuals, corporations and governments will be allocated to the News and Opinion Pool by the Olas Foundation.&#x20;

[News and Opinion Topic Pools](broken-reference)

Olas topic pools are deployed by Olas developers for topics that require regular reporting. Active donors participate in funding competitions that occur in these topic pools.&#x20;

[**Demand-Based Allocation**](broken-reference)

Olas implements a market-based allocation system to ensure fair and efficient distribution of funds to topics and journalists that deserve them most[.](broken-reference) This system evaluates the level of interest in articles in each topic pool based on a set of metrics that reflect this interest.     &#x20;

**How it Works**

A contributor who wants to write on the platform can enter a funding competition in a given topic pool. Active donors can then vote on the proposal and donate money to the topic pool. The amount of money that a donor donates is equal to the square root of the amount that they value the contributor. This means that donors who value the contributor more will donate more money. Contributors will receive a matching donation from the topic pool equivalent to the number the earn according the above formula. If there are insufficient funds allocated to the topic pool by the global matching pool, matched donations will be paid as a percentage of the share of the pool contributors earn on account of the quadratic rules. &#x20;

**Benefits of the News and Opinion Funding Mechanism**

The Olas funding mechanism offers several benefits, including:

* It allows funds be allocated in a decentralised non-hierarchical fashion, somewhat removing politics from the equation
* It frees contributors from editorial direction imposed by private owners of newspapers and science journals
* It enables contributors to grant open access to their work without needing to worry about being rewarded for it&#x20;
* It ensures local and niche information is economically viable&#x20;
