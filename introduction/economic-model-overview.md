# Economic Model Overview

The Olas economic model design is based on five assumptions:

1. Information is one of the rare types of good not particularly well served by _fully_ private markets.
2. Even if private markets could adequately supply it, it's much preferable for it to be subsidised as a public good because the payoff from widespread access to information vastly exceeds the cost of subsidisation.
3. Information platforms should not be governed by human hierarchies because those hierarchies will inevitably introduce accuracy damaging politics into the equation even if  the platform is non-profit.&#x20;
4. Subsidies will be a viable economic model in the coming decentralised internet with native payments infrastructure that enables single click micropayments.&#x20;
5. Public good subsidies are _much_ more effective when subjected to market forces.

### Information is a Natural Public Good.&#x20;

Information is easy to propagate and consequently difficult to suppress. This is especially the case in the modern digital world when reproducing information is a trivial task that involves little skill and know-how. Consequently information is best viewed as a natural public good. Private business models have responded to this reality by either offering information for free and monetising it with advertising or increasingly by using subscriptions to gate access to it.&#x20;

Advertising has known deleterious effects on the quality of information output in the internet age. It is the click rather than the content that generates revenue and newspapers optimise accordingly.    &#x20;

Subscriptions attempt to create artificial scarcity in digital information by gating access to their content. However  the subscriber base of these news and science platforms tends to be a narrow section of society. To best cater to this market, the suppliers of information are selected from this section of society too. A situation has been created where groupthink is endemic and there is often ignorance of the perspective of large parts of the rest of society. These too greatly affects the quality of information output if not as severely as advertising does.&#x20;

Even if undesirable, we don't view subscriptions as a viable model in the impending decentralised internet (web 3). There are already archive websites the younger more tech savvy generation use to circumvent paywalls and coordinating to share subscriptions, articles and podcasts will become even more trivial in web 3. Combatting it will become next too impossible given the difficulties in censoring decentralised networks. &#x20;

### Natural Public Goods are best Subsidised and Offered for Free

It is very well-documented that access to information powers economic growth. Constraining its supply is therefore unsurprisingly damaging to growth. Since it is comparatively cheap to subsidise and trivial to do so in a way that increases competition, it is an ideal candidate to supply as a public rather than private good. Subsidies of naturally private goods tend to reduce quality as it is near impossible to subsidise them without destroying the competitive forces that increase quality and reduce cost. On the other hand, subsidising information and offering it for free is almost certain to be value additive given how it is essentially free to share and reproduce and how society benefits from this knowledge transfer.&#x20;

### Truly Ownerless Platforms are now Possible

When information is supplied by for-profit entities, there is an unavoidable conflict of interest between making money and supplying accurate and high quality information. Another issue is that owners often have other economic interests that are furthered using the platform at the expense of the accuracy of the output.&#x20;

Even absent economic interests, ideology is ever present in human groups. When there are hierarchical structures it is inevitable people will use them to further their ideas at the expense of competing ones. This is damaging to the marketplace of ideas that brings us increasingly better information.&#x20;

What is needed is a truly ownerless non-hierarchical platform to avoid these issues. Fortunately, the advent of blockchain technology enables such a thing. Developers can build applications and release them on censorship resistant decentralised computing networks. The decentralised applications (dApps) persist beyond the control of any single administrator, including if designed correctly, their creators. This paradigm brings enormous challenges in software and mechanism design but the possibility now exists none-the-less.

Another way blockchains have changed the game is via tokenisation. In order for dApps to be trusted their code must be open source and examinable by all given their is nobody at the helm and consequently no recourse if anything goes wrong.  Since open source code is a public good free for anyone to replicate, there has rarely been economic incentive to create this type of software. For that reason the internet is dominate by proprietary platforms with open source relegated to the domain of hobbyists and ideologues.&#x20;

Tokenisation has completely turned this situation on its head by attaching native tokens to open source decentralised applications. If a dApp proves popular, the value of the token, if designed on sound economics, can appreciate much like the stock of a successful business does. This final piece of the jigsaw means that not only are ownerless platforms possible, they are viable competitors to proprietary platforms. In fact they possess economic advantages that proprietary platforms don't possess.

### Subsidies are Becoming a Viable Model

Another benefit of blockchain techonolgy is that subsidies are becoming a viable alternative to advertising.&#x20;
