3. Public good subsidies are _much_ more effective when subjected to market forces.

In regards to the first point, when information is supplied by for-profit entities, there is an unavoidable conflict of interest between making money and supplying accurate and high quality information. Another issue is that owners often have other economic interests that are furthered using the platform at the expense of the accuracy of the output.&#x20;

This is especially the case in the modern digital world when reproducing information is a trivial task that involves little skill and know-how. Private business models have responded to this reality by either offering information for free and monetising it with advertising or increasingly by using subscriptions to gate access to it.&#x20;

Advertising has known deleterious effects on the quality of information output in the internet age. It is the click rather than the content that generates revenue and newspapers optimise accordingly.    &#x20;
