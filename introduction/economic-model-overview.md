# Economic Model Overview

The Olas economic model design is based on three assumptions:

1. Information is one of the rare types of good not particularly well served by _fully_ private markets.
2. Even if private markets could adequately supply it, it's much preferable for it to be subsidised as a public good because the payoff from widespread access to information vastly exceeds the cost of subsidisation.
3. Subsidies will be a viable economic model in the coming decentralised internet with native payments infrastructure that enables single click micropayments.&#x20;
4. Public good subsidies are _much_ more effective when subjected to market forces.

### Information is a Natural Public Good.&#x20;

When information is supplied by for-profit entities, there is an unavoidable conflict of interest between making money and supplying accurate and high quality information. Another issue is that owners often have other economic interests that are furthered using the platform at the expense of the accuracy of the output.&#x20;

Further, information is easy to propagate and consequently difficult to suppress. This is especially the case in the modern digital world when reproducing information is a trivial task that involves little skill and know-how. Consequently information is best viewed as a natural public good. Private business models have responded to this reality by either offering information for free and monetising it with advertising or increasingly by using subscriptions to gate access to it.&#x20;

Advertising has known deleterious effects on the quality of information output in the internet age. It is the click rather than the content that generates revenue and newspapers optimise accordingly.    &#x20;

Subscriptions attempt to create artificial scarcity in digital information by gating access to their content. However  the subscriber base of these news and science platforms tends to be a narrow section of society. To best cater to this market, the suppliers of information are selected from this section of society too. A situation has been created where groupthink is endemic and there is often ignorance of the perspective of large parts of the rest of society. These too greatly affects the quality of information output if not as severely as advertising does.&#x20;

### Natural Public Goods are best Subsidised and Offered for Free

It is very well-documented that access to information powers economic growth. Constraining its supply is therefore unsurprisingly damaging to growth. Since it is comparatively cheap to subsidise and trivial to do so in a way that increases competition, it is an ideal candidate to supply as a public rather than private good. Subsidies of naturally private goods tend to reduce quality as it is near impossible to subsidise them without destroying the competitive forces that increase quality and reduce cost. On the other hand, subsidising information and offering it for free is almost certain to be value additive given how it is essentially free to share and reproduce and how society benefits from this knowledge transfer.&#x20;

### Subsidies are Becoming a Viable Model

Subsidies are becoming a viable alternative to advertising and subscriptions for a two reasons.&#x20;
