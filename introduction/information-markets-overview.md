# Information Markets Overview

Olas' information market-based quality control mechanisms are designed with five assumptions in mind:

1. Information supply today is subject to numerous undesirable incentives. &#x20;
2. The way to minimise these incentives is to not only remove human hierarchies from the administration of platforms - as discussed in the previous section - but to also open up the systems of quality control. The two proven mechanisms we have for reliably aggregating information in an open setting are **markets** and **reputation**.
3. Markets are an incredibly effective tool but their efficacy is dependent on them being designed with the specific problem that's to be solved in mind. Otherwise the incentives involved may be sub-optimal.  &#x20;
4. Prediction markets, although evidently a powerful tool with great potential, have generally failed to gain mass adoption outside of sports and to a lesser extent politics. Some of the reason for this is regulation, but another major factor, in our view, is that they require subsidies to entice bettors.  &#x20;
5. The great weakness of open systems is their vulnerability to collusion. Open systems vulnerable to collusion risk devolving into a system just like the one they wish to replace.&#x20;

### Poor Incentives Produce Bad Outcomes

As discussed in the previous section private ownership of information platforms has deleterious effects on information quality. Newspaper owners shape the information that is provided on their platforms via an editorial direction. These owners generally have economic incentives that often run contrary to publishing the truth on certain matters. Further, in the internet age, the requirement to get a click or publish articles agreeable to one's subscriber base introduces incentives that also often run contrary to writing the truth.&#x20;

In the field of science, journals are similarly pressured to publish new and exciting breakthroughs. Further, those with influence over the peer review process also have economic interests that can lead them to influence that process in accordance with those interests.&#x20;

These incentives have a very noticeable effect. Depending on the country, 40-60% of news articles contain factual inaccuracies. This is far too high to be completely accounted for by honest mistakes. In the field of science there is a replication crisis. Over 85% of the findings in scientific papers turn out to be false. There have also been numerous instances of corruption of the peer review process resulting in papers with findings that are uncomfortable for prevailing interests and ideologies being published.&#x20;

What is needed therefore, is not only an ownerless platform as suggested in the previous section, but open non-hierarchical systems of quality control that don't grant positions of power that can be corrupted to anyone.&#x20;

### Open Quality Control Mechanisms

Markets are the most effective tool humanity has for aggregating information. The secret to their success is best described by the "Skin in the Game" thesis. There is no substitute for the prospect of being rewarded for being right and conversely being punished for being wrong for focusing one's mind. As such well-functioning market can be viewed as a truth telling machine that encompasses the views of numerous people with money on the line. There have been numerous studies that have shown prediction markets to be better at predicting outcomes than subject matter experts that don't have money on the line.&#x20;

Thus far, aside from markets, the only other effective quality control tool humanity has is an open context is a reputation system. A reputation score is a shared memory of a person or institution's performance at a certain activity. This shared memory is very useful to prospective customers. Reputation systems thus work on the basis of similar incentives to markets.  The only difference is that changes to a reputation score effects the holder's future earnings whereas changes in the price of a market position affects current profitability. A positive update to a reputation score is likely to result in increased business in the future whereas a negative update normally results in less custom.   &#x20;

### Olas Market Designs

Olas aims to harness both markets and reputation in tandem to produce high quality outcomes. The markets will settle on a view of the quality of a contributor's output and a reputation score will keep track of their historical performance in each of these markets so that prospective donors have clear insight into who is most deserving of donations.&#x20;

However, each sector of information in Olas brings different challenges. The reporting of news generally involves reporting information that is publicly available and thus doesn't require many market participants to verify its accuracy once there is also an incentivised fact checking system.&#x20;

Opinion pieces bring the challenge that the truth is often an unpopular view and those holding that view are disincentivised to bet, particularly when there must be settlement within a reasonable timeframe so the contributor's funds aren't held in limbo for an excessive amount of time - something that in turn would disincentivise contributing in the first place. There's a famous saying in trading that "the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain liquid". In this case, the market can settle before it updates its opinion (becomes rational). Consequently, contratrians with insight are faced with a situation where they've little chance of profiting from their knowledge. In order to remedy this situation we need to implement a mechanism specifically designed for such an undesirable scenario.&#x20;

### Olas Information Market Mechanisms Summary

1. **Fact Reporting Market**: Ensuring Accuracy & Accountability
   * This market is focused on verifying the accuracy and integrity of news and articles. It features two main roles: **Fact Checkers**, who scrutinize articles to identify inaccuracies, and **Judges,** who evaluate these findings for validity.
   * The process starts with the submission of articles by **content contributors**, followed by an open phase for fact-checking where anyone can submit potential inaccuracies. These inaccuracies are then verified by a randomly selected panel of expert judges. Fact Checkers and Judges are rewarded based on the quality and impact of their contributions, ensuring a high level of diligence in the review process.
2. **Investigative Journalism & Academic Research Markets**: Aligning Incentives with Societal Value
   * This market supports in-depth journalistic and academic research, areas often undervalued in traditional systems. It combines public subsidies, prediction markets, and retroactive funding to align rewards with societal impact.
   * In this market, **content contributors** propose investigative questions relating to an area of academic research or journalistic enquiry. The market rewards contributions based on both **factual accuracy** and broader **societal impact**, encouraging meaningful research and reporting.
3. **Opinion Market**: Harnessing Collective Intelligence
   * The Opinion Market is a platform for diverse **opinions** and **predictions** on various subjects, utilizing the **Surprising Popularity Algorithm (SPA)** to evaluate these viewpoints.
   * The SPA is an innovative approach for gauging public consensus and improving decision-making, differing from traditional majority voting methods. It works through a dual-question mechanism where participants answer a factual question and predict the majority's response to the same question. SPA then identifies the "surprisingly popular" answer, which is more popular than participants predicted, indicating it may reflect an important insight.
   * Unlike majority rule which can sometimes lead to suboptimal decisions if the majority is misinformed, SPA goes beyond this by uncovering responses with unexpected support. SPA analyzes discrepancies between actual responses and predicted popular opinions, highlighting insights or predictions that are unexpectedly popular yet significant. This method effectively taps into the collective wisdom of the group, revealing insights that might be overlooked in conventional polling.

In essence, these three markets work together to create a robust, transparent, and inclusive information ecosystem. Each market addresses different aspects of information dissemination and evaluation, from ensuring the accuracy of current news to supporting in-depth research and harnessing collective intelligence for forecasting and understanding diverse viewpoints. The interaction between these markets ensures a comprehensive approach to information integrity. This market-based approach ensures not only the accuracy of the information but also its depth, societal relevance, and diversity of viewpoints.
