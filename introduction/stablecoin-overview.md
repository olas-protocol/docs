# Stablecoin Overview

Stablecoin design is based on a number of assumptions:

1. If the protocol is to achieve its goals of maximum autonomy and providing journalists with an extremely secure platform where they can shine a light on those in power, a censorship-resistent currency is required.&#x20;
2. Many users won't want to be exposed to excessive currency volatility and will want their earnings predominantly dependent on their performance in the markets.
3. Almost all currencies that attempt to fix to an external peg fail.&#x20;
4. Successful currencies that remain stable are governed with low levels corruption and remain stable within their own economy. The are _relatively_ stable against other stable currencies as a result.&#x20;
